# Agents

## What is an agent?

An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

## Tools vs actions

`Tools` are individual tasks the agent can perform like do a web search or send an email. `Actions` on the other hand are the steps the agent takes and may involve muliple tool calls.

## What are some examples of agents?

 - Personal virtual assistant
 - Customer service chatbots
 - AI NPC characters in a game

# Large Language Models

## What is a large language model?

A large language model is an AI model that excels at understanding and generating human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn patterns, structure and even nuance in language. These models typically consist of millions of parameters.

## What types of transformers are there?

- Encoders - Transform text into a dense representation
- Decoders - Focus on generating new tokens to complete a sequence, one token at a time
- Encoder to Decoder

## What is a token?

A token is the unit of information an LLM works with. How a token is represented is model specific but tokenization often works on sub-word units that can be combined.

## What is attention?

Attention focuses on identifying the most relevant words to predict the next token.

## What is a prompt?

A prompt is the input that is provided to a large language model. Careful design of a prompt makes it easier to guide the generation of the language model toward the desired output.

## What types of messages are there?

- System messages - 
  - Also called system prompts, system messages define how the model should behave
  - Define available tools
  - Formatting instructions
- User messages
  - Human generated messages
- Assistant messages
  - Responses generated by the language model
- Tool calls
  - Tool names and named paramters
  - Tools are run client side
- Tool responses
  - Results of running a tool

## Base model vs. instruct models

A `Base Model` is trained on raw data to predict the next token. An `Instruct Model` is fine-tuned specifically to follow instructions and engage in conversations.

# Tools

## What are AI tools?

Tools are a function that is given to an LLM. Functions should fullfill a clear objective.

## What is needed for a language model to use a tool?

Information is added to the system prompt for each tool that can be used. A description of what the tool does and the exact inputs and outputs must be provided. While we can provide the description using plain english, it is more common to use programming languages to define tools. The reason people use programming languages is because they are expressive, concise and precise.

Example:

```python
@tool
def calculator(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiply two integers."""
    return a * b

print(calculator.to_string())
```

Key details:

- `@tool` decorator
- Type hints on inputs and function return value
- Descriptive docstring
- Sensible function name

# Thought, Action, Observation

## Core concepts

Agents work in a continious cycle of thinking, acting and observing

1. Thought - The language model decides the next step
2. Action - The agent takes an action by calling tools with parameters
3. Observation - The model reflects on the response from the tool
